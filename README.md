CS348 Information Systems Final Project


Had issues with accessing my frontend folder in github after I committed it, so I uploaded app.js seperately which is where all my frontend code is. 

Additional concurrency notes because I didn't go into it in as much depth as I should have in the video. I made the isolation level serializable which means that it has the maximum amount of concurrency. There can be multiple users on this platform operating it at once due to this.
